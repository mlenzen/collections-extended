``collections_extended`` documentation
======================================

``collections_extended`` is a Python module providing
	- a ``bag`` class, AKA **multiset**,
	- a ``setlist`` class, which is a **unique list** or **ordered set**,
	- a ``bijection`` class,
	- a ``RangeMap`` which is a mapping from ranges to values, and
	- a ``IndexedDict`` class.

There are also frozen (hashable) varieties of bags and setlists.

The ABC :class:`collections.abc.Collection` is backported to Python versions < 3.6

It is `tested against`_ Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 & PyPy3.
The current version no longer supports Python 2, install a
1.x version for a Python 2.7, 3.4 or 3.5 compatible version. New features will
not be developed but serious bugs may be fixed.
